# 📊 Visual Analysis of Stock Market Data using Yahoo Finance API

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on the **visual exploration and analysis of real-world stock market data**
using an **API-based data collection approach**.

The Yahoo Finance API (accessed via the `yfinance` Python library) is used to extract
historical stock prices, trading volume, and dividend information.  
The project emphasizes **data visualization and storytelling**, without applying
machine learning models.
